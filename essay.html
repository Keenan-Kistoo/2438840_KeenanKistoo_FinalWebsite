        <p class="essay-text">
          During my tertiary education experiences, I have come to the
          realisation that I take several practices, ideas, and theories for
          granted. Honestly, I do not think I have ever acknowledged a good user
          interface or commended a good experience when interacting with a
          website. However, I have always vented my frustrations when website
          interface elements were confusing.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          A website’s user interface (UI) comprises of the interactable elements
          that allow the user to navigate through the website and/or communicate
          certain information to the user. This includes, but is not limited to,
          navigation icons (hamburger button, gear cogs, etc.), search bars,
          on-screen buttons, and so on. Each website’s UI is built according to
          a certain layout.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          User Experience (UX) on the other hand, refers to the quality of the
          interaction between the UI and the user. A positive UX can be achieved
          through various concepts and ideas such as the use of familiar icons,
          responsive and efficient websites, and allowing the user to reach the
          information that they require as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          Now, both of these definitions are fairly vague, however, by the end
          of this essay, I hope to explore the ideas further by analysing the
          SuperSport website (https://supersport.com/.). I have interacted with
          this website for several years, and as technology evolved, the website
          evolved with it. SuperSport is also one of the oldest sports
          broadcasting channels in South Africa and being an individual that is
          very passionate about sports, I felt it was rather fitting to discuss
          how this particular website has built its user interface to achieve a
          positive user experience.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          The article, The Basic Principles of User Interface Design by UXPin,
          discuss several ideas surrounding a good UX. One of them is, “placing
          the user at the centre” (UXPin, 2020). A major part of the SuperSport
          website is publishing news articles. It is important to note that,
          unlike sports-specific websites like LiveScore
          (https://www.livescore.com/en/.), or RugbyPass
          (https://www.rugbypass.com/news/.), SuperSport publishes articles,
          press conferences, highlights, results and fixtures of a variety of
          different sports. They achieve this centring of the user by displaying
          articles consistently across the UI. Each article has a title, a
          category and a timestamp which allows the user to navigate to an
          article that is relevant to them. The articles are also displayed from
          the most recent to the older articles, which ensures that the reader
          is reading relevant news.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          In the screenshot above, several UI design choices are made to display
          certain information to the user to create a positive user experience.
          In another article by UXPin, several Web Developers and Designers
          discuss aspects of good UI design (UXPin, 2021). Weber discusses
          “consistency and clarity” as two crucial elements of a good UI (UXPin,
          2021). When a mouse/trackpad cursor, hovers over an article, a shadow
          surrounds the article and the image zooms in slightly. This features
          creates a positive user experience as it clearly shows which article
          is being hovered over, however, certain faces or text may be cut out
          slightly. This is an example of good intention but could create a
          negative experience as certain players could be indistinguishable.
          Again, this is dependent on execution, if the website is tested
          efficiently by the web developers, this should not be a problem. The
          triangle pointing to the right and is surrounded by a circle or a
          ‘play button,’ communicates that there is a video or audio aspect
          involved in the article.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          In terms of consistency and clarity, the user can see where they are
          on the website. Under “Football” on the navigation tab in Annexure 1,
          the user can see a white line showing which tab they are on. This
          could be clearer if a different colour is used like the dark red in
          the SuperSport logo to keep within the colour scheme, but the user’s
          position is still being communicated. Also, the football tab is made
          up of different sections (Home, Fixtures, Results, and so on), and the
          website effectively communicates that the user is in the Home section.
          To summarise, in the image, the user is in the home section of the
          football tab. Each section, be it Rugby, Cricket, or Golf, is
          illustrated in this same way. This consistency allows the user who is
          interested in multiple sports to navigate through each sports section
          easily.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          Upon searching for some of my frequently visited websites to base this
          essay on, I pushed a few to the side due to the excessive number of
          advertisements present on the websites. Advertisements play a huge
          role in negative user experience. They often draw attention away from
          the purpose of websites or delay the user from getting the necessary
          information. However, there are several ways to optimise a website to
          ensure that advertisements are not breaking the website. Google uses
          “My Ad Control” to allow users to control what ads they see and why
          through settings (Finn, 2022). Now, for many websites, this is not
          possible. Google is a major search engine that is visited frequently.
          SuperSport on the other hand is visited on a need-to-know basis. A
          user wants to know the result of a specific match, they search for
          SuperSport and navigate through the website. I do not think that web
          developers need to go to such a far extent to ensure their site is
          optimised for each user. We can work with what we know. SuperSport is
          a sports broadcasting and news website, if a user accesses this
          website, they have an interest in sports. This is already one factor
          to consider when choosing advertisements. Another process could be
          implementing surveys. Ask the user to take a survey to ensure that the
          advertisements are relevant to the user. In Annexure 1, we see that
          there is one advertisement per section. The user sees the navigation
          bar, and then an advertisement; the first set of news articles, and
          again an advertisement. This does draw the attention away from the
          website slightly, but it is not as frustrating as multiple pop-up
          advertisements that force the user to interact with them.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          The quick access bar in the footer section of the UI also creates a
          positive UX. It allows the user to access all parts of the website
          without having to click and search through each tab. It also acts as a
          summary for SuperSport as it shows all the information available on
          the website.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          Small changes and elements that emphasize interface objects play a
          major role in the user experience. Highlighting selected text and
          changing the cursor from an arrow cursor to an I Beam when input is
          available or to a hand cursor when there is a link creates clear
          communication between the user and the UI. When a website is
          intuitive, it allows the user to gather the information they need
          easily.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          Another positive aspect of the UX is that the website does not force
          you to external websites for news, highlights, etc. This allows the
          user to stay in an environment where they are comfortable and that
          they trust. Videos are played from different websites like YouTube;
          however, the videos can be enjoyed within the website. This also
          encourages users to return to the website as everything that they need
          is in one place and also ties in with the ethics of interactive
          design.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          For the next part of my essay, I will be drawing on the ethical
          concerns that Peta Goldberg discusses in the Ethics Of UX Practice
          You, Your Audience And The Weight Of Experience lecture slides
          (Goldberg, 2021).
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          SuperSport gathers scores and results across several sports and
          displays them accordingly, however, the articles and interviews are
          still completed by humans. Therefore, the site uses modern technology
          to improve the efficiency in result gathering but does not eliminate
          the jobs of reporters. Was this improvement necessary? Yes. At the
          time of writing, South Africa faces several power outages (load
          shedding) daily. People who cannot afford backup power supplies such
          as inverters, generators, and so on still should be able to keep up to
          date with the sports that they are passionate about. This improvement
          in score gathering allows users to access results and commentary much
          quicker. I do not think that removing the human aspect (“de-skilling”)
          from sports journalism will result in a positive user experience
          (Goldberg, 2021). Human ideas and thoughts add the edge that makes
          articles interesting for users. Similar to commentary, major sports
          commentators create a better experience for viewers.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          DS-tv broadcasts the matches that SuperSport has access to. When
          navigating through the SuperSport website, there are mentions and
          links to signing up to DS-tv and their partner, Showmax. To some
          extent, this can be viewed as “nudging,” however, it does not force
          the user to the broadcasting sites (Goldberg, 2021). It is important
          to note that the goal of the many broadcasters and/or websites, is to
          make a profit. If there are any ways that they can give the user the
          option to access their channels to make a profit without forcing the
          users to pay or provide any information, it takes the form of indirect
          advertising rather than unethical design.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          For a news website like SuperSport, the core of ethics surrounding it,
          is to upload objective articles that are well-researched and do not
          spread any false information. To ensure that this is standard
          practice, SuperSport needs to monitor the information published and
          communicate to the users if any information from previously published
          articles were incorrect. Taking accountability for mistakes or false
          information allows the website to build a good relationship with users
          and in turn create a better user experience.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          I underestimated the amount of work and thought that went into
          designing a user interface. As an aspiring web developer, I am hoping
          that with time and experience, my website development skills will
          improve tremendously. Currently, I feel that I overdo certain aspects
          when a minimalistic display would be more effective. After going
          through several websites, I have realised that clear communication
          between the user and UI is more important than a website that is
          aesthetic with poor communication.

        <p class="essay-text">
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) Models have taken the digital world by
          storm. It allows us to access information quickly and efficiently,
          without scouring through several websites. However, when technology
          advances rapidly, we are often blinded by its ease of use and do not
          thoroughly evaluate its risks and faults. We do not only overlook the
          validity of the information provided but also the intentions of the
          powerhouse tech companies/countries that release them. The Centre for
          AI Safety (CAIS) made a statement regarding the urgency of outlining,
          discussing, and analysing the potential risks that come with
          artificial intelligence (CAIS, 2023).
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          Looking at it from a broad perspective, several countries still do not
          have reliable internet access or are not completely technologically
          efficient yet. On the other hand, there are countries where the
          internet is accessible, however, their “percentage of internet
          penetration” is far lower than other countries (Graham & Sabbata &
          Zook 2015: 92). Regardless of their infrastructure or internet
          literacy, or lack thereof, the internet is advancing faster than the
          spread of accessible internet access. Developing and less developed
          countries are again being “left behind” and disregarded in the
          introduction and evolution of AI (Chatterjee & Dethlefs, 2022).
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          I have given a brief overview of the issues with the introduction of
          AI, now I would like to dive deeper into the statement the CAIS made
          in relation to The World in www and Digital Inequalities.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          As a starting point in discussing how AI is an existential threat to
          the world, I would like to discuss how AI affects various employment
          procedures. This refers to the AI model’s ability to do a certain job,
          and to what extent it completes said job. For example, a language
          model like ChatGPT can generate, edit, and/or explain a code, that
          will carry out a desired outcome. The generation of this code already
          replaces a developer as it creates a starting point for individuals,
          companies, businesses, and so on. What stops individuals, companies,
          etc. from using this language model to create code and have fewer
          employees who only modify and implement the generated code into their
          particular environment? If this hypothetical scenario becomes a
          reality, this will lead to a drop in the employment rate for
          developers. We do not understand the capabilities of the self-learning
          models and cannot predict how quickly they may or may not evolve. Now
          this is one particular job that can be affected by AI language models.
          What about jobs that have already been affected by automated systems
          and self-learning AI language models? In an article published by
          Sensorium, they discuss the jobs that AI may replace such, as
          “customer support, receptionists, accountants,” and so on (Sensorium,
          2023). The takeover has already begun. For example, if you have an
          issue with an item you bought online, you first go through several
          processes with a chatbot to solve this issue before you are finally
          referred to a customer support representative (a human being). In many
          instances, appointments and job applications are all operated by
          automated systems. And what stops individuals from providing an AI
          model with their invoices to generate the books of their business? In
          the same article, jobs like “CEOs, PR management,” and other
          managerial roles are regarded as irreplaceable (Sensorium, 2023). The
          average salary for CEOs in 2023 is over R1 million whereas the average
          salary for a receptionist is just over R90 000 (payscale, n.d.). This
          means that, in some cases, higher-income earners are less likely to be
          affected by AI in comparison to lower-income earners. Sadly, this is
          the reality of the introduction of artificial intelligence. This leads
          us to the question: if an individual is forced out of a job due to the
          evolution of AI, how are they expected to get promoted and work their
          way up their respective ladder to reach the higher-income jobs where
          they are irreplaceable?
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          Digital “bias” and discrimination are major issues with artificial
          intelligence self-learning models (Ferrer, van Nuenen, Such, Cot´e &
          Criado, 2020). These models are designed to learn from a wide pool of
          inputs, applications, questions, phrases, and so on, to develop an
          appropriate answer or analyse a “data set” and generate an output
          (Lee, Resnick & Barton, 2019). Due to several factors, including the
          above-mentioned lack of internet accessibility, these self-learning
          models may not be able to answer certain questions or prompts
          accordingly as they do not often interact with these groups of people
          enough to provide the necessary information. This gives individuals an
          unfair advantage over less privileged individuals as firstly, the
          tools are easily accessible to them and the information gathered is
          relative to questions which are commonly asked within their regions.
          Whereas, developing countries, which have a lower number of users of
          these language models, will interact with the AI models less.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          To emphasize, AI self-learning models rely on trends and patterns to
          gain information and effectively answer prompts. However, this is also
          how stereotypes and societal norms are born and spread to discriminate
          against certain groups of people. In an article published by
          Brookings, there was a discrepancy with “facial recognition
          technology” as it did not effectively recognise “darker-skinned”
          individuals, and “women” (Lee et al., 2019). This was due to the fact
          that the “training data set” comprised a majority of white males. This
          is a major security risk for individuals of darker skin tones and
          “women” as facial recognition is an important security feature
          available on certain mobile phones (Lee et al., 2019). AI should not
          only be functional for a select group of individuals.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          Evidently, there are a lot of unsolved errors, discrepancies and
          limitations with these AI learning models; however, it is still
          available to individuals who have access to them. Let us look at a
          rudimentary example of this situation: if a car is not ready or tested
          effectively to be sold to the mass market, it cannot be sold. Why?
          Because there might be potential dangers, unknown risks, structural
          issues, and so on. Like said cars, there are a lot of unknown risks
          and factors that have not been found regarding AI. Why is it allowed
          to be active on such a broad spectrum? We do not know its full
          potential nor do we understand the extent and rate of its evolution.
          This makes AI dangerous. On one hand, it may offend an individual or
          provide them with incorrect information; on the other hand, users are
          not able to see where all the information was gathered from. If
          information is gathered from a specific resource, phrased differently,
          and outputted as a response to the user, we are discrediting the work
          of individuals who spent hours, days or even years to research and
          create the piece of work.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          In addition to the above-mentioned factors, artificial intelligence
          can also be invasive. If we look at advertisements displayed on
          devices, they rely on learning models. This means that your navigation
          path on search engines is monitored and stored to generate a suitable
          set of advertisements for each individual. This is described as
          efficient as it displays advertisements relevant to each person,
          however, it is storing information. Since these algorithms are
          generated to gain certain information, how can users be sure that
          these language models are not storing information that users do not
          want to be stored? This is another "what if?" question.

          A major concern with regard to AI is that there are too many
          uncertainties. It may generate incorrect information, or it may make
          an entire job redundant. We do not fully understand the capabilities
          of the artificial intelligence learning models and individuals cannot
          be certain that using these models will have positive outcomes all the
          time. If there could be a risk of extinction or higher unemployment
          rates, is it actually worth developing something that could be so
          destructive to the human race? Both yes, and no. These tools make
          tasks easier and quicker, however, there are risks to using these
          tools. To some extent, it is too late. These tools are published
          already and are a part of the future. They are used in schools,
          universities, jobs, and several other environments. It would be more
          helpful to try and understand or grasp the extent of the self-learning
          tool’s intelligence and capabilities. Knowledge and understanding are
          one of the many ways to mitigate risks and create a digital
          environment free from digital inequality. An individual should be able
          to use these tools regardless of their race, sex, gender, and so on.

          Now, the burning question: Do I believe that “mitigating the risk of
          extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other
          societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war?” (CAIS, 2023).
          I do not think that there is a simple yes or no answer to this. I have
          presented various facts and scenarios that support this argument;
          however, I do think that to some extent that pandemics and nuclear war
          are a more recent concern than the dangers of artificial intelligence.
          I am aware that it is better to be prepared for something than to deal
          with unexpected digital catastrophes, however, the world is still
          recovering from COVID-19. Diseases and nuclear war often affect
          everyone regardless of their wealth or intelligence. If there are any
          sort of catastrophic risks that can be predicted with AI, the models
          should be removed, reworked, and republished when humans can be in
          full control. An employee of Google was placed on “paid leave” after
          he believed that a “chatbot” showed signs of emotions (de Urquia,
          2022). Even though it was dismissed by Google, if AI develops
          emotions, it is important to compare it to a newborn living being that
          does not fully understand how to process and express itself
          effectively. And something so powerful whose intelligence may grow
          faster than their creators’ is an important factor when discussing the
          “risk of extinction from AI” (CAIS, 2023). If we do not acknowledge
          the evident risks, there will be consequences for this. It is a matter
          of dealing with issues effectively and working with different groups
          to ensure that digital inequalities are mitigated, and also we must
          question whether exceptionally effective automated systems are worth
          increasing the unemployment rate and poverty rate.
