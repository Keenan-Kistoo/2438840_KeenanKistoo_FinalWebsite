          At this point, my website is functional but, it does look a bit too
          cluttered. There are a lot of elements that look good aesthetically
          but serve little to no purpose in navigating through the website. My
          goal is to try to reduce some of these elements to make sure that the
          user is not distracted by unnecessary elements when they are trying to
          navigate through the website. Once I have cleaned this up, I will
          finally replace the placeholders with my blog posts.

          Since this is in a lot of detail in the Design Section of my website,
          I thought I would rather discuss whether I have achieved the goals I
          set for myself at the start.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Goal Alignment: I do think that I was successful to some extent. My
          website is easy to navigate through and is not at any point
          misleading.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Information Structure: Throughout my website, I tried to ensure that
          only essential information is present. I also tried to give users a
          little more information in the form of descriptions and comments when
          necessary.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          User Flow: I used a navigation bar to ensure that there is a loop from
          and back to the homepage. I tried to stick to the three-click process
          throughout my website. There are a few points where it takes four
          clicks but never more than that.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Design Elements: I do think that this is where I struggled the most.
          The website is very basic in terms of design. My night light setting
          was on for a large part of the design process which did not help this
          process. I would like to improve on this in the future.
