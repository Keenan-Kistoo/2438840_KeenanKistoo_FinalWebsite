          I had previously installed and worked with GitHub. After completing
          the 'tutorial repository,' I have a basic understanding of how GitHub
          works.

          It took me a while to process the reading because of how content-heavy
          it was but I tried to break the different ideas down. In my attempt to
          analyze the reading, I tried to find similarities between the library
          and the internet. There are two that I believe are worth mentioning:
          1. the "number of hexagonal galleries" are described as "infinite"
          (Borges 1998: 112). To search and process that much content will be
          overwhelming. With the internet, information can be accessed quicker
          but there are still various websites/pages that can be accessed. Even
          though information can be gathered more efficiently, the variety is
          still the same ~ there are valid points but also unnecessary
          information. 2. Borges discusses the identical layout of each gallery.
          This makes it easier for people to navigate through and within the
          galleries. We practice the same ideas when creating
          websites/applications/etc. in the form of symbols. For instance, the
          gear cog or magnifying glass represents settings or a search bar
          respectively.

          Most of my time is spent searching for the spelling of words that I
          should know how to spell, football news and on social media. I spend
          about 3-4 hours a day on the internet (5-6 hours if I have some time
          to play games).
